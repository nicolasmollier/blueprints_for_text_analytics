      "0: No Club Colors: Funny story. I went to college in Las Vegas. This was before I knew anything about motorcycling whatsoever. Me and some college buddies would always go out on the strip to the dance clubs. We always ended up at a bar called Hogs & Heifers. It's worth noting the females working there can outdrink ANYONE. Anyway, there was a sign on the front door that read 'No Club Colors'. So we lose our ties and blazers before heading there. Also we assumed bright colors like red, yellow, green etc were not allowed. So we would always bring an xtra t-shirt and pair of jeans. This went on for years! Looking back now on how naive we were, it's just hilarious. I was never able to walk out of that bar....had to crawl out! So much booze. Cheers. Ride safe, boys!\n",
      "1: Mystery Rattle: I have a stock 2010 FXD that has a rate I can't locate. I can only hear in first and second gear and at idle. I believe it may still be happening in other gears but it's hard to tell with the noise from the wind. I thought it was the starter drive gear (bendix) so I changed that out and it's still happening. I also took the outer primary cover off and close mechanic friend of mine looked at everything inside and said it looked perfect. After talking to a couple othe wrenches, I have been told it could be the compensator or it may also be gears rubbing in the transmission. Any insight would be much appreciated!\n",
      "2: Gum on tailpipe: So I'm on a bike trip with my father and we stop to get some food. We park our bikes in a metered spot and are gone about an hour. When we got back to our bikes, i noticed something on the exhaust under the right saddlebag. Some asshole put a wad of gum on the top of the tailpipe almost out of sight. Lucky i had a spare rag and, with water, able to get it cleaned off. This pissed me off for the rest of the day. Has anyone had this done to their bikes? If so what happens if you run the bike and pipe gets hot with the gum on there?\n",
      "3: Changing up the bars!: So I'm gonna change out my T bars that came on my 14'street bob and I'm thinking about the San Diego bars from lucky daves.

I slouch a little when I ride so I wanna go taller I was thinking the 14s since they claim you dont have to swap cables with their 14s. Anybody runnin these and how do ya like em?\n",
      "4: Spent 2 days and made some Mini Floorboards for my Sportster: A few weeks ago, somebody was looking for some Mini Floorboards, and I was amazed at the prices, I know, HD stands for Hundred Dollars. The idea of floorboard for a Sportster never occurred to me, and though that maybe they would help relieve some ankle discomfort that occurs on long rides. The pair cost me $18, including the rubber bumpers that remove all vibration. I call this a win, and a fun project for a home CNC Shapeoko Router. _URL_\n",
      "5: Cured buffeting on my Road King: 'Twas a few years ago when /u/Silverfox762 turned me onto getting a windshield for my Fat Bob because I wanted to get away from riding around town and wanted to ride far. So when I bought my Road King I went ahead and ordered the (_URL_ because I'm 6'3\" and I wanted to extend my riding season here in Wisconsin, so I bought the biggest one they had. I had issues with buffeting straight away.. Going on the interstate at higher speeds the HD windshield would wobble near the top and the only cure for the continuous *thump tump thump thump* in my Bell RS1 helmet was to haunch down or lean way forward which was not only uncomfortable but usually led to back issues a day or two after a 300+ mile ride. Getting a 3/4 helmet didn't help much either, as the buffeting would fuck with my eyes and make it hard to read exit signs on the highway. So I did a little research which consisted of multiple variations of the words *windshield*, *buffeting*, *tall rider* and *Road King*. I started reading more and more about (_URL_ I practiced my google fu for a few more months and finally ordered a Clearview. I put my OEM windshield over the Clearview so you can get a bit of perspective . (_URL_ The Clearview is about twice as thick as the HD windshield, as well. I took it out on the interstate and it did greatdoing 70 on this windshield felt like I was going 45 on the HD windshieldno buffeting. I turned off onto a county road and going 90 wasn't any different. They also have an option where you can order yours with a recurve at the top which gives me additional clearance from the wind. I got a 24\" with recurve, +3 wide, and also got the vent (_URL_ Nothing but positive experiences with the people at Clearview, they are a family owned place and have their friends working for them. They don't keep too many on stock so this did take about 3 weeks to get. Price of OEM windshield= $349.95. Price of Clearview= $232.50. TLDL: I'm tall, I bought a Clearview windshield, it's fucking awesome compared to my shitty OEM HD windshield. No more buffeting from the windshield. **Edit/Update**: I did a 240 mile loop today with in 44-50 degree weather with gale force wind warnings, sometimes riding right into the wind for many miles, everything was zen. This windshield is fucking awesome.\n",
      "6: Death wobble, what's your take on it?: I've been doing some reading on it. I bought a new 1200 custom and after watching that wipe out on YouTube where the guy became a meat crayon face first and reading plenty of stories and lawsuits against Harley for a known defect. What models does this effect? I know tire quality, steering head adjustment and a lot of factors play into it including rear and front tire alignment, but how common is this issue? Has it happened to any of you? Just know I'm not bashing on Harley at all, they make some great bikes but I just wanna be safe and be assured about some information m:\n",
      "7: Need an ID on some motorcycle parts!: Hello all, Been recently selling off some motorcycle parts for a family member, however I am not the most educated on Harley parts. They were all individually bubble wrapped in a box, so I assume they are part of a collection or such. If any of you can provide some form of ID, a link to the parts, names, anything that would be amazing. If you know the approximate price that would also be extremely helpful. Thanks a ton!

      "8: Stage 1 upgrades - suggestions: Alright, so I recently picked up a 2013 Road King with stock exhaust on it and as everyone knows it is super quiet...too quiet. I've also got a 2001 Night Train with open pipes on it, but I'd like this one to be somewhere in between the two. After reading countless forums and reviews I thought I had settled on 4\" Rinehart slip-ons, Arlen Ness Stage 1 Big Sucker intake, and V&H FP3 tuner. This is where I started second guessing my choices. I got some info that the quality on the Rineharts is a bit poor and have problems with discoloration, and that I should be looking at a set of 4.5\" slip-ones from V&H or RC. Then I start reading that the 4.5\" with 2.5\" baffles is too big for the 103 CI engine and I'll loose low end torque. Guys help me out here. I know a lot of this is subjective, but I also don't want to waste my money on shitty upgrades. What's everyone's thoughts on it? Edit: spelling\n",
      "9: Explain Power Commander to me like I'm an Idiot: I got a bike that has been tuned by a shop previously. From what I can see, I do not have the module, and this is where I'm lost. I thought almost every dynojet was bike specific? If I am looking at swapping pipes, and want to tune it myself, am I looking for a bike specific tuner, or is there one out there that does multiple bikes? Should I be checking connections on mine to see how it's been set up? Edit: I should clarify, I understand how it works and what it does, but I'm unsure of the setting up.\n",

I don't need storage all the time but for long trips or trips with the wife id like to be able to have some sort of storage I can add or remove quickly. Id also like something where I dont have to relocate tail lights. Anyone have any suggestions? Pros/cons of throw over? Thanks.\n",
      "12: Shaking under braking: Hello everyone. I have a 1995 Softail Custom and when you apply the front brake, it feels like the bike is rocking back and forth. It almost feels like my front wheel is oval instead of round. From my research, I've come to the conclusion that it's the steering head adjustment is out. I wanted to get some second opinions as I'm not the most experienced.\n",
      "13: Harley-Davidson Original Equipment Spark Plug or....?: 2005 xl1200c Sportster - 22k miles (ish)... Planning to change the spark plugs in May. I see there is a Harley-Davidson Original Equipment Spark Plug... is this the recommended flavor by the /harley folks. I've been an NGK plug user for 30+ years on cars. I'd like your feed back. Thank you in advance.\n",
      "14: Dyna fairings: I'm considering getting either the Memphis shades road warrior fairing or the rifle roadster fairing. Was wondering if anyone has experience with them and how they compare. I know the rifle is slightly cheaper, and it looks like it has a small vent to help buffeting, but I'm not sure.\n",
      "15: Help with suspension: Just bought my dream bike. 16 street glide. Having problems with the rear suspension. Ride is rough as hell and the bike doesn't squat when I sit on it. It has the manual adjustable suspension but it doesn't seam to be working. I pulled both shocks off this morning. The right one compresses just fine but the adjustable one will not move even with all the tension let out of it. My question is any tricks to get it unstuck or am I just screwed an need to buy a new set.\n",
      "16: (Stupid) Oil Question: So I got back from a ride last night and checked the oil in my 2018 XL1200X. It was well below the fill line. So I was like \"Oh no I need to get some oil.. Man I've only had this bike since February, how can it be out of oil\" So I buy some oil, and resolve to check for leaks tonight. Just got finished checking it over and no leaks, and on an ice cold check I have lots of Oil. So I run the bike for 30 seconds and recheck the oil. Still lots. So I run the bike for 3-5 minutes, and then check the oil again. Still lots, above the midpoint even. So what's going on here? Are you not supposed to check your oil after a long ride?\n",
      "17: ECU Relocation question (Heat concerns): Hello all, i'm about to relocate my ECU/ECM (2011 FXS Softail). With a smaller lithium battery i can actually fit everything in to the space now available. I am a bit concerned about heat generated by the ECU since it will be in direct contact with the battery. How hot does the ECM get? Do you guys think it might pose a problem?\n",
      "18: How was Laughlin this year? It seemed barren compared to last time I was there, 5-6 years ago.: Anyone else go to Laughlin this year? Talked to a couple of people about the drop in attendance and the speculation is that the room costs went up while the vendor's costs doubled or tripled from last year. So attendance was down and the vendor section (especially in front of Edgewater) was down. Didn't seem the same to me but curious to hear everyone else's opinion.\n",
      "19: DIY 10k Mile Service (Dyna): Thinking of doing this next weekend (...been putting it off...). I will have a service manual, but does anyone have any other web sites, YouTube videos, other helpful resources etc. that would help walk me through it? Assume I'm really, really goddamn dumb (although have done engine, primary and tranny fluid at least twice each at this point, so at least I've got that). Also, does it make sense to do brakes at the same time? It's a 2006 Super Glide, relatively new to me (maybe 6k miles or so). Wondering about both pads and fluid (and anything else I should be thinking of...). Also wondering if any specific part of any of that is more difficult, and might be worth paying for to avoid PITA. Considered just paying someone to get the thing over with since I've been busy, but won't have the cash for at least a month probably, and my priority with the $ would be new tires first anyway. EDIT: thanks for comments so far, I wrote that I had done brakes b/c I was thinking about brakes...I have not. I meant I had done primary fluid...which is why the other two thing in that sentence were engine and tranny oil\n",

      "22: 2015 Street Glide special - possibly buying: Just like the title suggests, I'm thinking of possibly trading in my BMW F800GT for a Street Glide special. Doing a test ride Tuesday to see if I like it. I'm about to go on about a 1400 mile trip, and my bike is simply not going to be comfortable for that long. Any recommendations on what I should do/look for on my test ride? I've never had a Harley, and the BMW was my first bike, so I'm not sure what to look for. Any way for me to know how comfortable the seat would be for a long trip? edit: bought an Electra Glide Ultra Limited(FLHTK). Got me a great deal, cheaper than the street glide that I couldn't pass up. Looking forward to my trip in a few weeks! This bike was incredible on the freeway.\n",
      "23: Twin Cam Reliability Upgrades: I just picked up a brand new street bob a few weeks ago. What an amazing bike! I want to ride this bike for the next 20 years. That being said, what upgrades can I make to the motor for reliability? I'm aware of the gear drive cam upgrade. Are there any other reliability upgrades I should make while doing normal upgrades on my bike? I'll be doing the normal order of upgrades, intake/tuner/exhaust, then cams, etc. Anything else I should be considering?\n",
      "24: '06 Street Bob Gear Drive Cams: With winter time coming up in a couple of months, I'm planning on doing some engine work on my bike. Going to send my stock cylinders to Axtell Sales to get them bored, and going to send the heads to Big Boyz to get them ported. I also want to install gear driven cams. Does anyone kow of a set of cams that will work with an '06 dyna and produce good low to mid range results? Sorry if this seems trivial. This is my first bike and first time going into the motor.\n",
      "25: Rebuild question: Ok. So I got this shovelhead last week, and I've been going over the extra parts that came with it. I have a few milk crates holding the original engine. Looking through all this stuff I can see a good bit of rust. I'm not worried about the jugs and other miscellaneous stuff. My main concern is the bottom end. It's not split but I can see surface rust on the flywheels inside. I'd like to rebuild and reinstall it. Maybe sell the s&s in the bike. What should I expect to pay to have the bottom end rebuilt? Where should I take something like this? Thanks!\n",
      "26: Brake Handle Tool/part required: _URL_ Trying to chase down my inadvertent brake light activation, which I do have narrowed to my handle, based on if I put forward pressure on the rear of the lever while riding the light will turn off. But will turn on during riding or even with a slight pressure. I watched a few youtube videos showing disassembly of the lever, but they all had a 10mm bolt on the back. This appears to be a snap ring of some sort. * 1. Is there a specific tool, or will a normal snap ring plier work? * 2. Is this OEM? * 3. Should I look at replacing this with another bolt? (part number/size/etc..). * 4. My 'assumption' is this has something to do with the internal spring in the handle... thoughts?\n",
      "27: Riding boot alternatives: Well folks, just bought my first bike and I lucked into a '12 fxdc. This is probably a really dumb question, so be as nice as possible, but is there any decent alternatives to boots that you guys prefer? Obviously for strict functionality they are the way to go but I'd like something more versatile from a style standpoint. I figured my Nike trainers probably weren't the best bet and I've never been a huge fan of Vans or Chuck Taylors either. Definitely not feeling the white nike look either. Are DCs decent? Any info is appreciated\n",
      "28: Handlebars tightening?: Hey guys; I was just riding, and I kinda gave my handlebars a little bump to make sure they're in place. (I do that every now and then cause ever since I got ape hangers, and this bike, they shake a lot. lol) When I gave em a little nudge, they moved forward. I pulled over and did it a few times forward and back, to double check. Any who, I assume it's the same on any other bike, but how would I tighten them in place? Side note: In case it helps, it's a 2012 883 Iron.\n",
      "29: Keyless ignition 2018 Forty Eight.: Hey everyone, I owned a 2015 FortyEight and loved it. I bought it from the dealership, the bike came with a keyless ignition and it was amazing. That fateful day came one October and I got into an accident and totaled the bike, but not me, thank god (ALWAYS WEAR A HELMET). I was out of commission for about 8 weeks for a fractured wrist. By the time I was ready to ride it was winter. So I held off on getting a bike until last week. I went to the dealership found a 2018 FortyEight I liked and bought it. Unfortunately, every single 2018 FortyEight had an ignition key start. Knowing what I knew about the 2015 model I figured I'll purchase the factory security system thinking that there would be some way to make it keyless. When I got the bike back the guy showed me how to start it, I was disappointed that I still had to use my key. I expressed my concerned to the service guy who told me that all 2018 models with security systems came that way, that I had to use the key no matter what. After inspecting the other parts I requested to be added, I found out that they put on a damaged rusted sissy bar, and forgot to install one of the passenger pegs. I told them to fix it and left the dealership pretty pissed. Once I came back to grab my bike I got the service manager involved and had the \"This part is obviously damaged why did you install it, you're wasting my time. \" conversation. After expressing my frustration to the service manager, we got into a more friendlier conversation about Harley Davidson. I told him this was my second FortyEight and I use to have a keyless ignition on my 2015, was it possible to do it on a 2018 model? he said \"Oh yeah I remember that, let me check\" He called Harley and asked about the keyless ignition and they told him to program the ECU not to look for the key. He hooked his computer up, programmed the bike to not look for the key to start, and BOOM keyless ignition. My key Ignition is still on the bike but I don't need to use it anymore. So I have a factory keyless ignition from the dealership for a 2018 FortyEight. Anyways I just want to say its possible to do it but you might have to talk to the right person to get it done. TL;DR: From the dealership, you can get a keyless ignition by installing the factory Harley security system and talking to the right technician about programming the ECU not to look for a key in the ignition. Part number: 41000087b\n",
      "30: This probably gets asked a lot.... so I'm thinking of getting a Harley: I'm 6 ft 160 pounds (very skinny, but decent shape, generic illness messes with my lungs and weight). I rode a gixxer 600 with a extended swig arm when I was young and dumb, upgraded to a cbr1000 for 2 years so rode for a total of 4 years, haven't ridden in about 4 years. Looking at getting a sportster type of bike. I dont really know where to start, the original inspiration was me considering buying a 2012 Harley night rod like 6 years ago. Went into a Harley dealership today sat on about 10 different bikes with a brand new saleswoman who self admittedly knew nothing, couldn't tell me the model or price of any bike. Spoke with the GM and he 2 bikes I sat on and started up that I liked were an 2018 883 and a 2018 fat bob. If I had ridden recently I'd have probably driven off the dealership on the fat bob. They said they wanted 18200 for the fatbob, the 883 was a lot cheaper don't remember the exact number on it though. All that being said I don't even know if used or new is right for me etc, gonna go back tomorrow and eat ride the fat bob and see how it feels. More just looking for some general advice. I'm not looking to finance and would just buy outright. Hell I don't even know if I want a Harley or an Indian or a triumph and why. Edit: Rode the Fat bob and loved it, but decided not to bit on a new bike. Ended up with a 2014 Night Rod from a guy that cares a lot about his bikes, he also had a fat boy, a custom drag bike and another bike I didn't ask about, all really clean and well kept. Only 1700 mi, ended up at $11,000 on it and it has after market shock on it to sit it a little lower and the tension is adjustable, he gave me the stock shocks as well, it has a vance and hines competition pipe on it and he had it dyno'd at a shop here as well. Felt like I got a pretty awesome deal for the first cruiser that ever caught my eye a few years back\n",
      "31: Engine Build List: I was hoping someone with some engine building experience could give me a little insight on a list of parts that I plan on using to upgrade the 88 TC on my 06 Street Bob. Parts list: 1) Send cylinders to Axtell Sales to be bored to 98 and fitted with pistons. 2) Mild street port and compression release on Heads by Big Boyz. 3) Cosmetic gasket kit 3) SE Premium tapered Adjustable Pushrods 4) Woods Performance lifters 5) Possibly Woods 777 cams (still undecided) 6) Probably Fueling Oil Pump Can anybody offer any feedback on that build list? Trying to figure out if all those parts mesh well together. I'm looking for lots of torque in the low to mid range with this build. Looking for somewhere around 10:5:1 Mechanical compression ratio. Any suggestions for additional upgrades are welcome, along with any substitutions for what I have already listed.\n",
      "32: Another one of those questions about prices and where to find bikes. Could really use some info and help.: This is my first post, as I am new to all of this. Never even been on a bike. That being said, its all I can think about; has been for a long while now. I am going to be taking the MSF course within the next couple weeks. I have always wanted a Harley, and I have my heart set on owning one. The thing is, I know nothing about them. So, I don't really know where to start. I am not a big guy, only 5'5-5'6, but stocky with short arms and legs. I do plan on sitting on several bikes, just to get the feel as to what I am looking for, but I figured I should get ahead start on knowing what and how to get a reliable, but affordable bike. I have been reading for a few months now, trying to figure out what it is I need. I am feeling a Sportster is right up my alley considering my height and build. Also, I love the all the crazy pictures of the custom sportys I see all over the web. New is not really an option for me, as my price will only be right around $3000 or so. I see people on the web say good conditioned sportys can be had for this price, but every ad I see are asking for $3500 and up. I know, that is just the asking price, but being new I wouldn't even know where to being in haggling with someone. I get that I need to sit on them, and to at least ride and to take the MSF course first, but let us put that aside. What are my options here? What is my game plan? What sites should I be using besides craigslist? The sporty is not a must have, but it just seems the best concerning my build. Dynas look amazing as well, but I feel I may be too short for such a bike; also, they seem to be out of my price range. These are my wants: Reliability, affordability, a bike I can ride comfortably, and I do want the 1200 over the 883 for sure. Reliability above all else. Colors and accessorizes are of little concern to me, as I want nothing more than the bike. Anything else I want I will add when the time comes. Any and all info would be greatly appreciated.\n",
      "33: ProBEAM Custom Dynamics tail light, anyone running one?: So i'm at odds with tail lights. When I got the bike the tail light was melted so i got a drag specialties and put it on and immediately took it off because i couldn't see it in my driveway. Then i put on a custom dynamics and was a little happier but seeing other guys running them they don't seem that bright during the day and that makes me nervous. Maybe the probeam is brighter, but i haven't seen one in the wild. I wish the people that made those stupid bright ambulance tail lights would make one for my bike. link - _URL_\n",
      "34: I will soon own a Street 750. Is it considered a real Harley?: Hey there! First of all, I really love this sub and the community that lurks around here. Several weeks ago I ordered my first bike, and since I'm only 21 my driver license doesn't allow me to have a bigger bike than a Street 750. (And on top of that, I have to nerf the power from 42 kW to 35 kW because of my age) I've talked a lot with Harley owners, and they pretty much say that the Street is \"garbage\", that it \"has the sound of a vacuum cleaner\" and that it \"doesn't fit in the Harley world\". I'd like to know if owning a Street is really considered a shame among Harley drivers, because in that case I won't apply for a HOG Motorcycle Club and just wait 3/4 years for my next real Harley.\n",
      "35: Shoei RF-1200 vs Bell Qualifier DLX w/MIPS?: Hey all! I am in the market for a new helmet and I can't decide between these two. I would love to hear your thoughts on them, if there are any. Thanks! UPDATE: Ended up getting the Bell. The MIPS was the deciding factor. I guess I'll just have to invest in some earplugs! :) Thanks everyone!\n",
      "36: Improving brakes on FXDB: '14 FXDB, 6k miles. Looking to improve braking, on a budget, as I'm trying to do a lot of other stuff on bike as well. Was thinking about getting lyndall extreme pads and braided ss line for the front. Thoughts? Recommendations on best bang for buck brake upgrade?\n",
      "37: Mini apes to drag bars: Alright I have a question for you all. How much would it cost to go from mini apes to drag bars? I would need new cables, and i'm not sure how much that would cost. I tried searching up some answers but I couldn't get a definitive answer. I appreciate your time, thank you!\n",
      "38: Changing brake pads on a '14 FLHCTU: Hey guys. I haven't had my Harley long and my brakes are finally due for a change. I'm keen to do my own work on the beast by nervous about the difference between normal pad changing and one with auto linked ABS brakes. I've tried to look online with limited success. Can anyone confirm I won't get half way through this and then realise I'm fucked?\n",
      "39: How to fix wiring to front turn signal 99 FXD: I was screwing in a front turn signal on my bike, and in the process accidentally tore the wiring a bit further out of the housing for the lamp. The light no longer illuminates. I'm new to this, but it seems like the wires were just yanked out from where they attach to the bulb. Can I just open up the housing and reattach them? Planning to give it a try tomorrow, but hoping for some more info.\n",
      "40: Streetglide won't start and horn problems: I've got a 2006 Streetglide (well I've been borrowing it, it's actually my father-in-law's bike.) I took it on a 1500 mile trip around Wisconsin and it was fine all week. I got back home, in Michigan, tonight and parked it in the driveway while I greeted my wife and kids. I came back out 10 minutes later to pull it into the garage and all of a sudden it wont start. It kinda sounds like a dead/low battery but I hooked it up to my car's battery and the voltage is reading 12-14 volts. The oddest part is that twice when hitting the starter sparks shot out of the left handle bar. I think they came out of the horn switch but I can't be certain. However, now when I press the horn switch, every 3rd or 4th press sounds like a fog horn - then it returns to normal. I'm thinking maybe a short in there somewhere though I don't know why this would prevent the bike from starting. Also, I rode 150 miles today to get home and it rained for nearly all of it. Any help is appreciated. Thanks\n",
      "41: Post-Prius update: Oof... just got the damage report and estimate from the dealer. I think my bike is gonna be totalled. 2,586,210 yen (about USD $22,500 ) in total. Crankcase got scratched up, so they gotta quote to replace it... which means a full engine rebuild. Between that and quoting the frame, I think the bike's likely getting totalled. Not happy about that. It's all structurally sound, just scratched up from the sheared off mid mount bounding around between the case and the pipes... it doesn't actually need replacing, but it has to get quoted. The good news is that all the parts I slapped on the bike will also factor in, so at a minimum I'll come away with a new FXDL. Might even work out to be enough to swap over to an FXDLS. Now, if the bike isn't totalled by the insurance company and the frame *is* OK, the damage to the cases is purely cosmetic, so the dealer says I'll be able to trade it in, in which case I'll be getting an S-Series and probably the 117\" kit to go with it. Fingers crossed!\n",
      "42: Clicking noise from Rear wheel?: The last like week or so I've been noticing like this creaking/clicking noise ONLY when rolling my bike forward rolling backward is noise free. It's definitely coming from the tire or belt pulley. I just had my Rear wheel bearings replaced probably about 7,000 miles ago. EDIT: My instinct is telling me it's the ids bearing maybe. I've looked my bike over and don't see any debris or anything.\n",
      "43: Spark plug issues???: I have an '01 883 sportster, that seems to go thru one plug if not both every month or couple of months, this is my first Harley so I'm just wondering if this is normal for them? I used to have an old Honda shadow and I never had to replace a plug. If it is a problem I would like to know, I'm just worried because it goes thru plugs like a fat kid thru M&M's.\n",
      "44: Gripe with Harley’s hydraulic clutch.: I recently moved up from a 2016 RoadKing to a 2018. Having my cable clutch replaced by a hydraulic one is driving me up the wall. I do a lot of slow speed riding and tight maneuvers and not having a friction zone in my clutch has proved to be a headache, especially on tight u-turns. I'm sure I'll work out the nuisances with this new clutch but for now I'll vent my frustration!\n",
      "45: Riding gear: Was just kind of thinking about this year's riding gear (since it's snowing out and I can't currently ride) and I started looking in to these jeans with Kevlar in them. Anybody have any experience with these? Are they worth the $150 everybody wants for them? Thanks in advance for any advice.\n",
      "46: I need a favour.....: So currently my partner and I are in the Atlanta, GA area. We have flown over from Australia to attend her fathers funeral, we have been able to hire an Ultra but they didn't have any jackets or riding gear, I was hoping that there might be some one on here that could help us out in the next day or two, we have the bike till Sept 3.

      "49: Dual discs and racetech internals on '14 Street Bob: I'm putting dual discs on my street Bob, and now I've got some questions that I'm hoping one you can answer. Thus far I've got the 11/16th master cylinder and brembo callipers off of a touring bike. I'm going to be buying the right fork lower from a low Rider, ss lines, and new pads. I've got 10k miles on my left rotor, would it be ok for me to just buy a new right one or would the wear difference cause issues? I also found a pair from an 06 flhx w/ 10k miles i can get for $75, would they bolt up ok? If not, any cheaper aftermarket rotors you guys recommend? Also, while I've got the front end apart, I'm putting in racetech springs and cartridge emulators. I assume I'll need new fork seals? Anything else I'll need? I plan on doing some more research on that just wondering if anyone else has any input.\n"

      "0: Found this while riding, may be my new bike. heart warming story of to veteran bikers . (x-post from /r/motorcycles): Short intro; medically discharged, had my sportster repossessed, struggled with the ability to ride again after injury, once regained purchased a cheap but nice Honda Shadow. Recently my wife and I have come into a situation where it would be viable to start touring, a dream I've always had. So for the past few months we've been searching for a good 2010-2014 road glide ultra, everyone we found was expensive as hell. **Story;** I was riding around town , actually turning onto the crossroad by my house when I spotted this beauty sitting at a local coffee spot. I quickly darted in, it took my breath away. Not trying to be rude, I snapped these 3 pics as quick as I could and hopped back on my bike, smiling, when the owner strolls out. I get to talking with the owner, turns out he was in the coastguard in Viet-fucking-nam (I was in the navy). So we shoot the breeze about that for a little bit. And I finally ask if I can hear it, so he fires it up. I start practically drooling, walking around it, checking everything I can. I take a step back, and tell him I appreciate him, his service, and taking the time to let me see his bike, but I needed to run home and show the wife his bike, o knew she'd love it. Then he hits me with it, \"well, it's for sale\".... So we start talking a little more. It's a 2012 Road Glide Ultra (touring pack at home) with **14,000** miles. He showed me pictures of two panheads and a sportster he had at home. Turns out the guy spends 3 days a week at the VA on dialysis, one of which is the same day I'm there (weird!?). He said he bought it, road to sturgis and Idaho and then started to get sick. He and his wife couldn't tour anymore, so he takes it out once a week to see his daughter at the coffee shop . My wife and I are talking with the Harley dealership and our bank to take his loan payments off of him as well as the bike. The way I see it now, he's right side up a few grand, and I'm going to throw him the difference in cash. **TL;DR** I happened upon a great guy, a wonderful story, the bike of my dreams, and potentially a friend to kill hours at the VA with.** Thanks for reading guys. I'd been having a Rough streak latelay, so to happen on this whole situation where I get something I want and can help out a fellow service vet is absolutely thrilling to me. Cheers guys, happy riding!\n",
      "1: How can I tell if my 88 twin has been converted to 96?: Is there a way for me to tell if my 05 softail deluxe had an engine upgrade prior to me owning it, from 88ci to 96ci without tearing the thing apart or taking it to a mechanic and spending unnecessary money? I bought the bike 2 weeks ago from a mom and pop dealer and while conversing with the dealer he mentioned it was a 96 and not an 88. I was (and still am) a bit ignorant to the multutude of ways a V twin can be upgraded but I am learning more every day. I bought the bike because I love the ride, not because of the engine size but now I am curious if he was telling the truth or filling me full of BS. Is there a visual cue or some fairly simple way for me to know the truth? Any info is greatly appreciated.\n",
      "2: Super glide questions: The motorcycle bug has bitten me again and now I've been looking at super glides. I've never owned or ridden a big twin bike so all of my sportster knowledge is useless. What year was the last year for carbs on super glides and what should I look for when buying one? Most of the ones in my price range are early 00s or late 90s with around 40-50k on the clock\n",
      "3: Took two Harley Street Glides for a test ride today: Hey all, Just wanted to talk about my experience today. I have just recently moved from Canada to Australia and I had to sell my bike just before I left - being bikeless sucks! Thankfully my now wife is super supportive and has been actively pushing me to get us a new ride. We rented a 2017 Street Glide a few weeks back and took a day trip into the mountains to the north of the city - it was such a comfortable ride, that it spoiled us for anything smaller. After looking at a few different options, we circled back to a Harley. Today I hit the local shop and took out two different years, a 2016 and a new 2018. I started out on the 2016 which only had 5,500 km on it... very lightly used! It rode very well and certainly pulled well - what I was not expecting was the difference the new 2017/2018 engine and transmissions offer. When I hopped on the 2018..... holy hell. I knew there was going to be some level of gain with the new design, but I wasn't expecting that much! The engine was so smooth and felt more responsive... and that gear change... I was instantly hooked. I am sure I had the biggest grin on my face while popping up and down the gears while tossing the bike around the roundabouts. The shop is pulling together some values for me on a used 2017 with 988km on it (owner bought it and returned it for a breakout) and the last 2017 Special they have in the shop. Hopefully I won't be bikeless within the next few days! Thanks for listening!\n",
      "4: I was hit on my motorcycle on the freeway, not sure how to settle with insurance: As the title says, and I am not sure if i should be posting in /r/legaladvice or elsewhere, but I thought if anyone else was hit on their motorcycle, it be nice to get advice. I (31M) was in an accident about 2 months ago. Someone changed lanes into me on the freeway. Luckily we were in traffic and I was only going around 10 mph when we slammed together, but I broke my leg, severely bruised my ribs, my hand was banged up and my foot completely crushed. It was deemed their fault and the insurance company will take care of all the bills, but i need to deal with a settlement for the time i missed for work as well as pain and suffering and any medical bills i will incur as i get older is more issues come up with my ribs/leg/foot/hand. Should i hire a lawyer or just handle myself? I don't want to pay a lawyer but i know they can get more money so it evens out. Anyone been through this before? Also, how much info should i give the other insurance company? Do they need my SSN? Thanks! Ride safe out there and always wear the right equipment, i know i wish i was wearing my riding boots over just leather boots. I'd be running by now.\n",
      "5: Bike dies at idle, no trouble codes. Any ideas where to start: Last night when I started up the engine would start fine but then die almost immediately. I had to keep pressure on the throttle to keep the RPM up in order to ride. After an hour or so it would be fine, I could idle at stops with no issues. This morning I started and let the bike warm up for a few minutes with no issues, no pressure on the throttle to keep the RPMs up. I took off to go to work, and every time I slowed down and downshifted neutral to stop the RPM would drop way low and the bike would die. Hit the start button and it would fire back up, I'd have to keep pressure on the throttle, and made it to work. 2015 FXDB, 8k miles, aftermarket exhaust, air cleaner, FP3 tuner. Tried pulling trouble codes last nigh and there were none. Any clue where to start to fix this?\n",
      "6: Help with some aesthetic parts: Just traded my bike for a 2012 street glide. It came with a touring seat that has an adjustable backrest. My girl rides her own bike so I've been looking into solo seats. Ideally I'd like something tan/brown that's got some nice stitching, is comfortable, and has a backrest option like the seat I have. If anyone can point me in the right direction I'd really appreciate the help. Also I'm looking for a good handlebar mount for a cellphone.\n",
      "7: I broke my body: So two and a half months ago, I ripped full speed \\(35mph is what the police report said\\) directly into the side of a Toyota Camry, because the little guy driving was too busy trying to find his undropped BALLS to LOOK LEFT before pulling into the fucking street. I broke my left hip, ankle, femur was compound fractured out the front of my fucking leg, and shattered my left knee. Right upper arm was broken too, so that made getting around fun. /s Anyway my point is, the biggest source of stress I have explaining all this shit to people is, \\*it was not at all my fault.\\* My brain, in fact, blacked the whole thing out. I may as well have fallen off reverse cowboying a really fat dude or something. But here we are. My lawyer's good, so I hope Junior and his fucking Toyota enjoyed having money. But I hate having to explain, I've been riding these road cruisers as hard as the footpegs'll let me for 26 YEARS. I DID NOT AT ALL CONTRIBUTE TO THIS ACCIDENT. And, since so many midlife crisis motherfuckers are out there in the ditch on their fuckin' off\\-the\\-rack hogs, it largely gets assumed that I contributed in some degree to the injuries I've sustained. Y'know how in the average accident, there's always sone decision or decisions that you fucked up, no matter what side of it you're on. Not this. Just, Ta\\-Daaaaa! And I'm in the hospital suddenly, deepthroating a plastic tube, wearing the most godawful shit the hospital could find. Good luck and godspeed, gentlemen. I'll be back out there teasin' cock as hard as ever, once I build my next Softail.\n",
      "8: R-Title for first bike?: I've grew up riding dirtbikes and racing ATVs. I recently got a wild hair up my ass and took then passed my MSF class. Local guy (friend of a friend type deal) has an 08 Road King Classic with 30000 miles and an R-Title for $7500. The price seems okay, as most other RK's are around $9k for this year. Bike seems to be in great condition. What's the deal with R-TItles?\n",
      "9: Long shot: anyone in SLC that can save my life right now: If anyone happens to have a 5/16 chaser tap, I could use a hand. Exhaust head bolt backed out and the one that stayed wobbled a little and the threads are slightly gross, I think they can be saved if I can chase them. If I can make it to St. George tonight I can get a pickup and a ride home. I got replacement bolts, but I would have to force one to get it to go and I don't want to make it worse and fuck the head / need an insert. Obviously a long shot but I'd be grateful.\n",
      "10: Dealership update: Hey everyone this is a follow up on: Previous Post After everyone's advice I went out on Saturday to get a second opinion on the bike. I went to these guys who had done my seat and work for others I know in the past. It took around 10 minutes of looking over the bike before Colin told me that my local dealership were talking out their arse and my bike was fine. I suspected my it would be based on the age and mileage. Everyone here thought so too. Thanks for the advice and support everyone!\n",
      "11: Quick front wheel bearing question: PICS HERE: _URL_ So I'm undergoing a partial frontend swap on my '98 sporty. Switching wheel and front fork sliders to upgrade from pre 00 brakes to the better calipers of post '00. So got a nice deal on a wheel/rotor (w/bad tire, gonna replace anyway) but the sealed bearing...doesn't seem too sealed? How much resistance should be expected from these bearings? thanks y'all\n",
      "12: Does anyone have any experience with JW Speaker LED headlamps?: So one of the shops near me just got in some JW LED headlight and spotlight bulbs in and I'm interested in getting them. I have heard that JW actually makes the Daymaker for Harley, is this true? All the reviews I have seen speak pretty highly of these lights, but a few more opinions never hurt. I'd appreciate any input, thanks!\n",
      "13: Ironhead Sportster for first bike?: I'm finally looking at getting my first bike, after wanting one for years. I'm on a tight buget, so my options for the style I like are pretty much Ironhead Sportsters or 90s-mid2000s Vstars or Shadows. I'm wondering if I'm getting in over my head on a bike that old though - one is a 76 XLCH & one is a 77 XLH. Should I consider one of these bikes, or just go with one of the Japanese ones until I've ridden more and can afford a newer Harley? My longer-term goal is a Dyna, but it'll be probably 2-3 ears before I can afford one, even used.\n",
      "14: '84 FXR headlight problem after swapping out tach &amp; speedo cluster: Last season my speedo crapped out and I had to replace it. Luckily I found an unused '84 FXR speedo/tach unit. Just finished swapping out the unit and after putting everything back together I've found that headlight high beam works, but low beam doesn't. In my defense, I did turn the power on to make sure the headlight worked but I neglected to check high/low beam. I consider it lesson learned... I had pulled the headlight out to try and figure out how to get at the wiring block. I never did anything with the wiring inside the headlight bucket since while it was out I found that the wiring block is actually on top of the bucket beneath the hood with the oil/neutral lights. Right now the controls are hanging loose because I'm also changing out my bars. Question is: I really don't want to disassemble everything if I don't have to - if the high beam works but the low beam doesn't, does that most likely indicate it's the headlight? Or is it possibly a wiring problem? And if wiring, what's a likely culprit (controls or wiring block)?\n",
      "15: Exhaust question for 2017 Iron 883: I have been looking for an exhaust for my new 2017 Harley Iron 883. However everything seems to be Vance and Hines. So my question is everything in seeing from other companies for an 883 is marked \"2009-2014\" are these the same fit. Or am I stuck with Vance and Hines ?? I'm looking for something very short like some boot burners\n",
      "16: Importance of Preventative Maintenance: As someone who often does his own work on his bike, I am ashamed to say the Factory service manual does not always come out, especially for the more mundane stuff like oil changes or swapping accessories (mirrors, pegs, etc). Well, I have noticed /u/silverfox762 and several others on here posting about 5,000-10,000 mile checkups on certain parts of the bike, doing torque checks and whatnot. I learned a trick from an aircraft mechanic. He said that if you consistently clean everything, it is a great time to check for wear and tear. Things like dry rotted rubber, bad gaskets, leaks, etc. This has usually been good advice until about yesterday. My buddy and I were cruising along on his 2004 Electra Glide Ultra Classic when his back end started to shake a little bit. We were on a back road doing about 45, he slowed down, wobble started putting Shakira to shame and he ended up putting her into a ditch at about 10mph and luckily high-siding in a controlled roll. We picked the bike back up, got it home and found his rear wheel bearing had failed spectacularly. One side had started to lose ball bearings, which caused the instability in his rear tire. We got the part from Harley and fixed it that day. I guess this is long winded but an important lesson. My wife and I were on that bike not 40 miles ago doing 80 on the highway. He rides that bike an hour plus every other day through the middle of nowhere. We were lucky it wasn't worse. Do your preventative maintenance! I am not saying you need to replace stuff that's not broken, but if we had checked on his bearing beforehand it could have prevented him needing new knee fairings and crash bars. It is worth the money to get the $30 bearings and such beforehand than replacing fairings at $200+ and new crash bars. PS Crash bars saved his fairing and bags, probably worth their weight in gold.\n",
      "17: Exhaust Recommendation for a '16 Softail Slim: Anyone have a good recommendation for a set of pipes that are louder than the factor shotgun pipes, but not so loud as to piss off every person in my apartment complex? Has the 103 in it. I've been keeping my ears open for pipes on a bike like mine, but I'm not really seeing any. The only other slim I've seen around me had pipes that were basically cut just past the footboards and they were insanely loud. Good for that lady, not so much my style though. Edit: Spelling\n",
      "18: Broken exhaust stud - not seized: Hey folks, I'm replacing the allen head bolts that are being used as exhaust studs on my bike with... actual exhaust studs. They all came out fine except one - it was turning just fine, but then the bolt broke off. It's got about 1/4\" sticking out (plenty to put a nut on) and maybe about that much still inside. The obvious answer is \"have a nut welded on it and turn it out the rest of the way\" but the nearest chopper shop straight up refused to do it (\"won't work, it'll get too brittle and break again, never seen one work\"), welding places are quoting me insane prices ($100 just to weld a nut on), other more distant mechanics are saying it'll be a while before they get around to it. Is it possible that if I screwed a nut on with red loctite it would hold enough to turn it out, or am I crazy. It was taking some oomph to turn, but not THAT much oomph, before it snapped. I can't quite get two nuts on it or I'd do that. Any other options before I bite the bullet and have one of these insane welders do it? Thanks!\n",
      "19: Rebuilding rear master cylinder (98 sporty): So looks like I've lost almost all my rear brake over the last few months/years with daily riding. No obvious signs of leaks from hoses/plumbing. Bled them and did all other simple things to spec, so I'm thinking it's just time to rebuild the m.s., but from looking around I hear that once you take the rear caliper off braking power loss can happen? But the brakes were already feeling mushy before I put new tires on... Just wondering if there's more to this problem than I currently see. Worst case scenario, could it be a bit of crap in the lines even after it's been flushed twice? Anybody got ideas, or a good recommendation on parts for a rebuild? I mean the bike is almost 20, it's time for that anyway. Just trying to feel out what else in the braking system I should address.\n",
      "20: Looking for a banjo type bolt: I just set up a new intake and I'm setting up a crankcase breather kit. I'm looking for a specific type of breather fitting. It's like these: _URL_ Except there's 2 male nipples across from each other on one fitting. Anyone know where I could find something like that?

      "21: Bike wouldn't start this morning. Thoughts?: I live in Austin Tx, where the past week has been more or less nothing but cold and rainy, so I can say up front that my riding time has been pretty minimal. My Softail Slim S 110 normally cranks a tad slower than my 88ci Fatboy, but since the weather's changed, I've noticed the Slim doesn't want to get out of bed as much in the morning. The first night of a front about two weeks ago, it took two tries to turn it over, but it fired up. I tested the battery that night, and it gave me 100% and greenlight the alternator as well, but I decided to hook it up to a tender anyways. After that, it fired up like normal until the past weeks weather conditions, where I just wasn't able to do a ton of riding. It didn't crank on three tries today, after being ridden for a good couple of hours yesterday, but the temperature dropped pretty sharply overnight. I've got it on a tender again, but am not really sure where my next point of interest might be. The bike is more or less brand new, as I bought it in August and just did the 5K service on it. Since the battery gave me an all clear reading, and all the connections are clean and tight, what may be the issue? I'm guessing even if it were something more major that the dealer or factory would cover it this close to the sale date. Thanks for the help, guys. I'll try to answer any other questions you have as best I can.\n",
      "22: The Ride for Life: It always makes me happy to see people still wrenching on, maintaining, and riding their bikes from youth (70s/80s). Today trade ins are a common thing, but what's one bike you can't imagine parting with? The one to ride til the end? Personally, even though I'll be moving on to a bigger bike, I plan on keeping my '04 Sporster just for how surprisingly fun it's been around town and the reliability factor for taking the abuse while I was learning to ride.\n",
      "23: Cam recommendations?: I've got to change the tensioners in my 01 FXDXT. I intend to upgrade the cam chest and swap over to geared cams to do away with the chain drive. I'm looking at S&S 509 since my bike is stock aside from Vance and Hines Big Shots and an Arlen Ness Big Sucker air intake. But if I can get away with something more aggressive that will last I'm open to suggestions. Harley suggested their SE 204 Cam Kit. Would like to hear your guys' input. Thanks\n",

      "25: Salvage Title Bikes - Are They Worth It?: I have the bug for a Harley since I was a kid and now it has been digging in even more since I went to a Demo Days last year. Unfortunately, home finances are rough and I was thinking about getting one as my daily ride. I guess this is out of desperation to get a Harley, but I have even considered looking at ones that have a salvage title that I could get for super cheap and possibly strip of some necessary parts or do small repairs to. Are these bikes worth it? I am in Missouri, can they even be titled and insured? I appreciate any help.\n",
      "26: Swapped Battery via Factory Warranty, now my gas mileage is awful.: Not sure which one is the chicken and which one is the egg, but I posted last week about an issue that ended up being the battery, and I was able to get it in and changed for one that would load properly. Now, however, my gas mileage has absolutely gone to shit. Last night, the range indicator had me at 181 to empty, and after running literally up and down the street for a couple of miles, it sat at 151 today. I just took it out to run it a bit in the cold weather and put some air in the tires, went maybe 6-7 miles total, and the indicator was at 109 when I parked it. It's not leaking, as there's no puddle in either of my parking spots, but you can actually sit and watch the gauge count down, sometimes in increments of two. The bike has a bit of a decel pop, but it had that prior to the battery swap, and the mileage held up fine. Does a new battery wipe the preset on the fuel tuner? Could I possibly just be \"unconfigured\" and getting the bad gas mileage from that? I'm open to any suggestions, but am a tad suspicious that this happened right after swapping the battery at the dealership. Thanks for your help, guys.\n",

It all ends in June!!!! My twins will be 18 and headed off to college. They have all encouraged me to buy that Harley i have always wanted but wouldn't until i was done with my obligations. I have never purchased a street bike before. I am a life long dirtbike racer, two wheels are in my blood. I have some questions to any one that can help. I bought a new car a few years ago and have since learned my negotiating skills are not what I thought ( i way overpaid for my car). I dont want to make that mistake with my Harley. At this point I am looking at a Fat Boy or a Heritage Classic. I cant go wrong either way. What would be some tips you would give some one walking in off the street to but a bike? In the past when I would purchase a new dirtbike, i would call around to the dealers and tell them what I was looking for and what price. It seemed to work in getting them down a bit, but I live in a area with only one Harley dealer to the south of me 60 miles and one to the north 140 miles. Any tips or suggestions in dealing with the sales guys would be appreciated. Thanks.\n",

Those springy metal wire things actually ended up scratched some paint near the rubber attach points. Is it safe to just put on the windshield and cut off those annoying springy metal wires?\n",
      "30: Bike not starting - 2008 FXSTC Softail Custom: New rider here, live in NYC and we've been having a brutally cold winter. I wanted to ride through the winter but we had a snow storm and streets were bad for about 10 days to 2 weeks, I didn't start the bike for a week, then I started it up on one of the warmer days (45 degrees) and ran it for a while. Then we had another cold snap and I couldn't start the bike after a few days of not trying. I was worried the cold drained the battery so I bought a battery tester and (if I'm doing it correctly) the battery seems to test as it is charged. I have a trickle charger coming today and I was gonna hook that up for a bit and try again when the weather gets a bit warmer. Has anyone else had this issue/ have any thoughts? TL/DR - Bike won't start in the cold, battery tests fine.\n",

It starts and idles fine, runs great at higher RPMs, but when I'm taking a slow corner and then rolling out, it'll cough out of the carb and lose it's power for a second before it get's running smooth again. I've checked for leaks with the manifold, tried adjusting the tuning screw, and can't figure out what it could be.

It has Rush slip ons and presumably a tune, but I'm trying to figure out what air cleaner I have. It has the stock football cover on it, but a 5.5\" round filter element with HD branding and a round backplate to match. It's not a k&n wet type though as I see on HD's website for the SE cleaners, it's a regular dry element filter. Did HD ever sell SE air cleaners with dry element filters?

      "37: Seeking opinions upon my compensator aspect: My bike is a 2012 TC96i FLD (here in my country the FLDs are TC96, not 103). I ride this bike hard, everyday, for commuting. Last friday I tried to start my bike after a stop at the gas station. The engine was hot and when I pressed the start button, it made a horrible grinding noise it never done before (very different from the bendix clicking). And when riding, a really soft rattling noise remained when at idle. After some reading and watchin videos with similar situations and noises, I came to think that It could be related to the compensator. So today I took the bike to the shop and asked them to open the primary and check for the compensator. And provide a diagnosis. I discovered that my bike already has the SE compensator kit and from outside it seemed like new. Then this afternoon the shop sent me that pic: _URL_ They said my compensator was thrashed, and I need to purchase a new one. Question: How true is their statement? Friends say that this is pretty normal for an already broke in bike. The shop is insisting that this is certainly the cause of the bad starts and grinding noises. Also, I know that the battery is bad. 11.98V when you turn the ign. Has been showing V inner after every start. Maybe this is the cause of the hard starts? instead of anything at the primary? Thanks for reading and for inputs!\n",

      "40: Where to get custom cover for V&amp;H V02 naked air intake: I had stage 1 done when I bought my bike (2015 SGS) but it was done on the default intake and they slapped the screaming eagle badge on it. I am looking for something with more air, and I have committed on the V02, but I would like to see about getting a custom cover done on it. Has anyone had something milled/CNC'ed or made. Are there any places that makes custom covers for them? While cost is not of concern (I don't want to spend a fortune, but you all know like I do how this hobby is).\n",
      "41: Epic Softail Slim Rant (x-post from HD Forums): I had a '96 1200 Sportster for like 10 years. Did a lot to it and definitely felt like it was mine. Sucked on the highway though. Served me very well. Upgraded from that to a '12 Softail Slim. It had everything I wanted (I thought). Already had an intake and exhaust, everything that didn't come black had been powder coated, and it had the look I tend to like (chunky front tire, spoked wheels, flat bars, blacked out, all that). I got this thing in March. Maybe it was the cold air talking but I decided to buy a Memphis Shades Bullett fairing for commuting to work (55 minutes, mostly 65-75mph highway). Maybe it's because I am 6'2\" but all the fairing did was blast me in the face with air. So I buy the laminar lip looking booster wing they sell for the fairing. Same deal, lots of air to the head. More than without a fairing. Then I go down the path of modifying a front fork air baffle to fit my fork. All said riding that thing at 75mph was like being in a blender of buffeting. It was horrible. Maybe if I was smaller I'd fit in the \"bubble\" that all this stuff was making. Fast forward to now and I've taken all that stuff off. Figured I'd get a full face helmet and some bluetooth to make the commute more enjoyable. Stay away from the Bell Bullitt. It's loud at speed, speakers don't fit as advertised, and not built nearly as well as an Arai or Shoei. But it's field of view is incredible. It's like you are wearing a half helmet. And ditch the stock seat. Couldn't be happier with the Mustang Wide Tripper and backrest. ANYWAY, everytime I get to work after riding I feel like this isn't the bike for me. I'm trying real hard not to judge it based on this horrendous stretch of highway I ride in the morning (back roads on the way home). Sometimes the wind is just right and my knees get blow apart and away from the tank. I don't want to say I'm squeezing the tank with my legs but that's kind of what it feels like. Sometimes I'll relax and if I let it happen my entire leg and foot will blow off the floorboard. It's like there is no weight on my feet. Like my legs are just kind of lying in front of me and I have to use all my leg muscles to keep them from flopping like a windsock. Makes me feel like I was using a thighmaster the whole trip there. Besides that I love everything about it. A touring bike would be great but I'm not doing cross country riding everyday. I guess I just equate a touring bike to one guy driving around an empty 18 passenger van or someone with a truck that's never had anything in the bed. I test drove a Road King but can't remember if my legs were catching a lot of wind. Never drove any batwing models. This should have been like 8 posts over the last few months but you guys are getting it all at once. Thanks for listening. UPDATE: Stock seat is back on and legs are better. Wide Tripper seat had me too far forward. Comfy as hell and the backrest was nice but I'm just too tall. UPDATE 2: Installed Cycle Visions 2\" extension kit for the floorboards and controls. Made a big difference .\n",
      "42: Patch: So this morning I woke up to go to work and my bike is my only transportation, I don't ride a harley. However this morning as I walk out to my bike I find a patch sitting on my tank it is a HOG patch. Not sure if there is any significance to this but it was pretty cool.\n",
      "43: Plenty of magazines and websites saying good rides but from your own experience what is a lesser known route where you are from?: I'll start, living in Ohio we have a small chunk of motorcycle heaven in our southeast corner and a few years ago I discovered a 15 mile section that is divine. Then last year I decided to ride most of it from near Ashland Ohio all the way to Marietta. None other than route 60 , this is a beautiful ride going alongside rivers and through the hillside and the roads were all very well maintained (as of just last season) and it's beautiful. After headed south of McConnellsville I took a detour to the Stockport mill located right on the muskingam river and damn if that isn't an awesome place overlooking the river. I recommend Marietta brewing company right downtown for a spot to eat, awesome local beer and the food is killer.\n",

      "46: Mechanically challenged rider needing advice about changing handle bars: I've gotten advice about air cleaner kits and pipes here before and now I'm looking at raising my handle bars. I was looking at the Biltwell Window 1\" handle bars but I know I need to change the cables as well. I've never done anything mechanical with my bike but only ride as much as I can. What tips do you guys have on changing handlebars? What tutorials would you recommend? I have a 2016 Iron 883 and I don't feel like paying $115/ hour for labor (i think that's too much).\n",
      "47: Need some buying help and couldn't find the answer in the FAQ: Pretty simple question. The buying guide in the sidebar is great for used but doesn't have much for new. I'm looking at a 2017 Street Glide. I started a little unsure of what I wanted and am 90% on the Street Glide Special, as long as some crazy awesome deal on an Ultra doesn't come along. Enough rambling, this will be my 4th bike, 2nd Harley, but 1st new Harley purchase. What kind of percentage should I strive to get off sticker. I am financing about half so the more I can negotiate off sticker the less out of pocket I have to come up with. I know some dealers will deal more than others, but need to know where to start.

      "48: What is this squeaking noise from my engine?: Video here: _URL_ Background: While changing my oil before a 600 mile trip I accidentally put about 6oz of Formula+ in the oil tank. I flushed it out with 20w50, then filled to normal capacity. Near the end of the trip I started to hear this sound. I don't think it got worse, but it's not going away. The oil level is currently on the low end of normal. I will be changing the engine oil again, but I wanted to get some opinions on what the sound might be, and what I should check for in terms of possible damage. Your help is greatly appreciated.\n",

Anyway the point I am making is that I have heard buying new Harley's is a mistake because they are junk or whatever but I buy American period. I buy American tools, cars, everything I can. If money was no object and you were buying a new Harley which would you buy? Should I buy used? Should I buy vintage? Thank you so much, I just have no idea where to even begin. Take care! Edit: Want to thank you all so much for the incredible amount of information you have provided. This is going to be great!\n",
      "1: Unsure if bike was remapped after v&amp;h exhaust: What's up guys. I bought a used bike recently, it already had v&h exhaust put on. How can I tell if the computer was remapped for optimal air/fuel ratio. Bike runs great but I don't see anything that would tell me whether it was or was not completed. I'm assuming since the bike is running properly it was but not 100%. Thanks guys, Cheers!\n",
      "2: Help diagnosing tappet issues: Recently on a trip back home my softail started to miss a little bit. I made it home safely and did some diagnosing. My vacuum petcock has been acting up so I replaced it and capped the vac line. Thought I was golden on a test ride until the bike died right at the bottom of my driveway. Get it in the garage and notice I'm running on one hole. Put my hand over the exhaust and feel no air moving from the front jug. Pull the exhaust, sure enough exhaust valve isn't opening. I pulled the pushrod covers and the front jug pushrods are not moving at all but I can still rotate them in my fingers by spinning them. The only thing that I am concerned about is the intake valve pushrod isn't moving up or down at all for that same hole. Should the intake lifter still move if the exhaust has failed? Had some lifter noise before this issue came up and I am hoping it's just a bad lifter and not something more serious. Thanks for the help!\n",

Anybody know of somewhere you can go to try out seats before you buy them? I'm hoping I'm not stuck just buying one online and hoping I don't need to return it.\n",
      "4: [Technical] 2014 Iron 883 won't start: I hope I'm posting this in the right place. So i had brought my bike in on Thursday because of some rattling noise. It turned out to be a baffle screw. I drove it fine that day, didn't get to ride on Friday, but on Saturday I was trying to ride home from work and the security light came on solid. I pulled over, looked my bike over, all seemed fine. Took several attempts but got it running. The problem: I put in my key, turn it and the lights come on. When I flip the run switch, there is no noise from the fuel pump. I tried starting anyways and, no love. What I've done thus far: I replaced the battery as I thought it was not sending enough (it wasn't in the best shape) and I've replaced both the 10A and 15A fuses just in case. My next step is to replace my fuel pump unless someone has a better solution?\n",

We're talking motorcycle shops, riding on my dad's little sportster as a kid. Now I finally got the money and bought myself a bike. (883 for those curious) I live in Hawaii and so most days it's a hot ride, and on the days it's not a hot ride it's going to be rain.

      "10: Street Rod 750... yey or ney?: Hello people of planet Earth, I'm currently stationed on Camp Pendleton and will be moving back to Arizona in the near future. Not exactly a secret that summers suck in Arizona (I'm from Tucson to be exact). I currently have a 2015 FXDB and have been looking at a liquid cooled bike because I know Arizona summer and air cooled engine aren't exactly the best combo. I test rode the Street Rod and it was a fun bike (even if some of the ergonomics are a bit wonky) and it would definitely be fun to hit the twisties in Sedona. But part of me says I could probably get a much better Japanese bike for the same price. Should I stick to my convictions of owning domestics or swallow my pride and get a Japanese bike?\n",
      "11: Harley smart security system not working: So, after finding out what my keyfobs are for, I realized that my security system is not working. I got my used 07 Sportster 883R about one year ago. Until now I never really cared what the keyfobs are for. I was just happy I could ride. Whenever I start or turn off the bike there are NO flashing lights or anything. &nbsp; This weekend I did some troubleshooting to find the problem, but I wasn't successful. I have both keyfobs connected to the keys, not one glued to the antenna. The partnumber of the kit is 68200-07A. * First I tried to start the bike with the fob 30feet away from the bike, no problem, bike worked fine. * After that I replaced the battery in one fob. No change * Then I removed the seat and the battery to check if the module is installed. It is. Picture of the module and a Picture of the antenna * I also tried to get to the menu with the speedometer, but nothing worked. Now that I know the hardware is already installed, I wouldn't mind using the system. Is it possible to deactivate the system somehow or what could be the problem with it?

My fork has been giving me problems for a bit, requiring WD-40 to turn the other day, even before that needing significant jiggling of the handlebars and key to turn. It has been better though, so I put off fixing it. Well tonight I went to ride home after riding out no problems and after having the same problem, and attempting the WD-40/handlebars/jiggle the key solution, the problem I described above happened.

I live in a major city so I have to deal with a lot of stop and go. I came across the \"Oil Bud\" (_URL_ in which the creator brags that his temp stayed at 195 degrees after a run through town and up a mountain pass. I told my mechanic and he said that might not be good technically because water boils off at 212 and if it is staying at 195 it could cause sludge. My question is: Has anyone ran this par? What is the ACTUAL running temp? Do you have suggestions on a cooler that is not bulky?\n",

I have a 99 Sporty 883 with factory forward controls. Purchased new. I've been out of commission for a while so the bike was parked in my garage, not moving for six months. I regularly started it, but never rode it. I'm finally better and can ride again, and went to ride it this week. I noticed that I had to \"reach\" a bit further to grab neutral, but thought it was my work boots. Nope. When I rode it, I could only get to second gear before it wouldn't allow me to go further. It feels like I'm in fifth, meaning, it hits a hard stop when trying to get to the next gear. I opened up my service manual, but not sure what to look for. It literally did not move for six months, and having something break seems strange. What could have happened??\n",

But as soon as I take off in first gear with out the choke, it stumbles and will die. It will accelerate while choked but I'm not sure if doing that for an extended period of time will help unclog the main jet. And if that's even a good idea. Will it need to have the carbes cleaned out or can I just blast it out with the choke at half mask for a little while? Is this even a good idea?\n",

I called the dealership 3 weeks ago and they told me the were renovating and that I couldn't see the bike since it was in the back in the warehouse and to call back the next week. I did exactly that and was told the same thing. I told them I knew what bike I wanted it and they assured me it wouldnt be sold until I was able to come see it.

Yet the shop is charging like 100 dollars an hour by me. I know that the shop gets some of the money but realistically for anyone who knows a Harley mechanic or any motorcycle mechanic, can you get me a real hourly rate? I make good money now but I think I want to follow my passions and work as a mechanic on bikes (Harley would be nice) then eventually open up my own 4-6 bay shop. I just want some discussion about real life expectations because I feel like google is super on the low side. This isn't some joke I'm genuinely curious And if I do decide to do this, I will attend a school or approved Harley program. I just want to know if it's worth it.

I'm pretty terrified about it. I saw the codes with the FP3, and they are PO152 and PO132, with a little bit of researching I found out that the two codes are about the engine running rich. However with PO152 it involves the O2 sensor running rich. At least that is from what my understanding is. Does anyone know what I can do about this? I'm pretty lost.

However, I live in cali and the freeway commute is a huge part of my daily/weekly schedule. Saw a couple of reviews mentioning that the stock suspension of this bike is somewhat lacking on a bumpier part of the freeways.

I've also seen images of the iron with after market handle bars and the speedo in front of the bars making it near impossible to see, is this on purpose or would this happen using aftermarket bars without relocating?

The previous owner had the original shift lever but not the linkage. I bought one from Drag Speciailties that they claim fits the bike but I think it's too long. In the the pictures in the link below you can see where the screw that attaches to the shift lever assembly is scratching the base of the cylinder. I can't shorten the linkage any more than it already is and if I tighten down on the screw at the cylinder side the screw will bottom out on the cylinder.

      "36: Just venting... rough day and many more ahead.: So a little back story here... I bought an Electra Glide from a dealer last year and during the test drive, it back fired and just overall didnt run right. It had the look, it had the goods, i was sold before i even test rode it. I test rode a couple others, they ran well but I really liked this specific one. When it hits you, it hits you. So in order to make the bike run right, they put in a SE Pro Super Tuner. Cool. No cost to me when i bought it and in about 3 weeks they had finally gotten it dialed in. Dealer said that there was a Power Programmer in it to begin with but was corroded to the point that it was malfunctioning. I drove the bike home, i was giddy and it was a happy day. I also found out my 88 Twin Cam was actually a 97 S&S with cams, gears, heads... anyways... 10,000 miles later i have learned the bike in and out. I know there is a slight stumble at 2250-2500, slow to fire on hot starts and it smells like its running rich at idle, but its burning my leg off going 20. So what do i do? Bought the cables for the SEPST decided to do a shit load of research. After reading the instructions, many many many many forum postings and reading it all over again. I decided to connect. It took a little bit of playing around and going through everything but i managed to find it all and get a good grasp of the system. I fired up the 'auto tune' feature and went off for a drive. 30 minutes later, i arrived back in my garage. Time to download. Downloaded the new information and it just kind of didnt show up... hmmm.... no biggie, i can run the tests many times, always an excuse for a ride right? Two things i wanted to change... deceleration enleanment and idle. I had a little pop in the exhaust on deceleration, but nothing crazy, simple adjustment. Idle adjustment... simple. I decided that these would be my first two major changes to change the bike to 'my bike' sort of an accomplishment if you will.... I press the flash button and viola... it begins. The first of many small changes to be a better bike. Then a message from the system. \"Flash Aborted, please check your cables and battery charge.\" It took me some time to realize that this was a very bad message. Not only because of the small changes i wanted to make not coming into effect... but because there was something else behind the curtain. My ECM no longer displayed the VIN, year, or model. Odd. Surely there must be a mistake.... I pondered and googled for about two hours before i picked up the phone and dialed the Harley dealer. Finally the receptionist gave way to the mechanic.... After speaking with the mechanic and going over symptoms, it is apparent that there is an issue with using a Power Commander, then switching to a SEPST. He stated its happened before and its generally only with the Power Commander and the SEPST. Then he says that i will need a new ECM, and because of that, a new SEPST as well. I was taken aback and as i told my wife what happened.... damn was i glad that my neighbor was there for a buffer. I did some more searching on the Internet but overall i will have to take it in and have them look at it. It does have an extended factory warranty that I bought with this bike, but the mechanic said that because it was altered (SEPST) that it was voided on that part. Go figure. And of course the SEPST is not covered at all... Any advice or thoughts/prayers would be great... Im gonna enjoy this here beer and contemplate life. TL;DR: Tried to tune my harley and ended up with a fried ECM. UPDATE: Spoke to a different harley dealer and he stated that he has the equipment to flash the ecm to stock, then add the stock tune. Apparently its not that big of a deal after all. 104 out the door to repair... woot woot\n",
      "37: Harley for a tall guy: Hey there fellow bikers! I've been lurking in this subreddit for a while now, and I'm just stunned about everyone posting their amazing bikes and that on the other hand makes me feel so sad for not owning a Harley of my own(yet, that is). And that's also why I'm asking this: I'm a pretty tall guy, 195cm (6'5 for my american friends), and for my whole life I have been riding with european and japanese bikes but always had a lust for Harley. Now I'm thinking of getting my very first. My problem is, I have never driven one, and I'm quite confused that what model would fit best for my height. Is there someone who is close to my height and could recommend some models that work well with tall drivers straight from the stock? I'm also interested if you have done some mods to your bike according to achieve better fit what comes to driving pleasure. Basically I'm looking bike for everyday use. Bike I can use when I'm heading downtown to meet my friends and a bike to travel around the world. Thanks for your opinions. I do know that I could just head to a dealer and testdrive the bikes I seem to like, but theres something that is still keeping me away from it. Maybe I just don't want to address myself as a total starter. Heh. **EDIT:** Thank you for your help and personal experiences! I truly feel relieved that there can be also a Harley for me. Trust me, I've been looking hundreds of Youtube videos and pictures people showing off their bikes and thinking \"Yeah, looks nice, but if I would sit on that bike it would look like a moped under me\". **EDIT2:** *fixed typos*\n",

How are they two-up? My girlfriend and I would be about 400lbs. I'm aware the bike is 400lbs. Not looking for much two up riding but I would like to cruise in town with her. Is there any reason they should be avoided? My main selling point is it isn't Japanese. I'm very anti-foreign car so I feel like I'd be a traitor on a Suzuki.\n",

      "41: 98 Sportster 1200s electrical problems: Just picked up a 98 XLH1200S. Rode it to work and back home, then minutes later decided to go out for a ride again. Turn the key, switch it to run, but it doesn't seem normal - only the speedo lights up, none of the other lights come on, the starter button does nothing. When I turn the ignition on, the speedo lights up, the needle buzzes and tries to move a bit then goes back down below 0. The tach does not light up. The run switch doesn't turn on the little red light in the gauge (the one that is supposed to be on for a few seconds before starting). No headlight, no neutral light, no engine light. Turn signals work but stay solid. Brake light works. Fuses are all good. But here's the kicker, found gas leaking from the petcock into the main wiring loom and coming out all the way down by the fuse box. Not sure what to do next.\n",
      "42: Heavy breather + Rain: Hey guys. I have a quick and simple question for all you people riding bikes with heavy breathers. I know I would have to put a rain-sock on the breather when riding in the rain. So far so good. But what I don't know is if I would have to put the sock on when I let it stand outside and it is possible that it starts raining later. How bad actually is it for a breather to be rained on? Would this put some major damage on the breather or even the motor? Is it safe to let it stand in the rain without sock and then start it after it stopped raining? Should a bike like my Lowrider S be always safely put into a Garage? I am going to bring these questions to my dealer when I pick it up anyway. I just thought this could be an interesting read for other breather-users in /r Harley. Thanks all and ride safe!\n",

He has done all the work on my bike since my 5k check up at the H-D dealership. When they did the 5k checkup they tightened the clutch cable.

      "48: Mechanical issues after replacing gaskets. Help, please!: My husband has an '07 Sportster 1200N. He was having a pretty bad oil leak out of the rocker boxes and a smaller one out of the primary. I bought him some James Gaskets and we set to work last Saturday. We successfully replaced all the gaskets, making sure to clean all the old ones and yucky stuff off. We changed the oil and oil filter, while we were at it. I sat with a toothbrush and Dawn soap, making sure to clean as much oil off the bike as possible so that when we went for a ride, we could see if there were any more leaks. There weren't! And other than some minor smoking from components burning off what little oil I missed, no issues. Yay! However, since then, he's experienced some sputtering, a lot more afterfire and popping on decel, and at least once, the bike died...while in 4th gear...on the highway. Luckily, he clutched in real quick and the bike started right back up. We thought it was bad gas (it had been sitting for a while as he didn't want to run the oil dry). Sea foam, then a new tank of gas... nothing. We thought it might be bad spark plugs (they were rusty and dirty) so we replaced them... still nothing. We thought it might be a loose connection somewhere, so we went back through and torqued everything down to spec... no dice. I'm at a loss. He's really frustrated and I don't know what to do to help. Even with my knowledge and history, I can't figure out what's going on. Has anybody experienced anything like this? Are there any suggestions? TL;DR - changed gaskets and spark plugs on '07 Nightster, now experiencing sputtering/dying. Plz halp! **EDITso it turned out to be an intake leak. We'll be working on it this weekend. Thank you all for the input!\n",
      "49: BEWARE of Progressive suspension products: so... after a lot of recommendations from friends all over... i decided in April that it was time to replace my stock suspension. i went with progressive monotubes on the front forks, and progressive 412 rear shocks. my experience with this company has been absolutely terrible. immediately after putting on the new setup, i regretted it. i set the sag per their instructions on the rear, but the heavy duty shocks they told me to purchase (based on my weight and what i carry) literally beat the crap out of me. i felt every bump... every small hole... it was excruciating. i called asking if there was something i could do... and was very simply told \"no\". so ive lived with it... fast forward to 3 weeks ago, i started feeling a little spongy on the front end. after i got back from that ride, i checked things out, and noticed that my front tire was severely chopped up with abnormal wear patterns. the very next ride, the front forks just pretty much gave out. when i hit the brakes, the bike dives, and will get stuck in that position til i power up and get moving again. progressive suspension will do absolutely nothing for me. they obviously have a lifetime warranty, but are telling me that i have to pull the suspension and send it to them for them to verify what happened, then they will return them. BEST CASE SCENARIO is that i am down for 3 weeks, but was told to expect anything up to 5-6 weeks. i offered to buy a new set then get reimbursed later... they said no. i offered to overnight them... they said it wouldnt help as they would still need several weeks with them. they apparently do not keep ANY products in stock. ive put a grand total of 9500 miles on the bike since changing out the suspension.... worst decision of my life.\n"

      "0: Selling my 2012 Fat Bob. Is my asking price reasonable?: I owe ~$7300 on the thing. I rode it for the tail end of one season and got a Grom. The Fat Bob has just under 20,000 miles and some cosmetic damage to the tank, front brake lever, and the heat shield on the slip-on exhaust from a low speed drop on either side. It sat for 18 months and the fork seal on the RH side began to leak earlier this year. I ride my Grom everywhere, and have dumped some serious cash into making it faster. After doing roughly 20,000 miles in 2 years on Groms(One was stolen and was recovered earlier this year), I'm looking at maybe a FZ07 next. Anyway, I've got the HD listed for $6300 and potential buyers haven't really been popping up. The Yamaha dealer offered me $5000 for my trade in a few months ago and I've just about accepted the loss I'm going to have to take to get rid of it. I got another offer today for $5k and I felt insulted. That's what I paid for my 2005 Sportster just 3 summers ago. Sure, I don't have the title in hand, but I wholly intend to pay the difference and have it within 10 business days. What would yall do? I'm honestly tired of looking at the thing and my payments are pretty steep at $373/mo.. I kinda rushed into getting it because that seat on the Sport was killing my ass and group rides with the HOG club were all I looked forward to. Thanks for reading. EDIT 9/21/2017: Sold it! Ended up getting ~$5250. I've got enough of my bonus left for a decent downpayment on a '17 FZ 09!\n",

Before looking at used bikes, just for the hell of it I looked at the 2018 lineup & honestly, to me the sportster 48 is gorgeous. But a new one is expensive, so I've been looking at older models. Are there are differences in the models during the years? I've read that there was an upgrade to the front forks for the '17 model, but is it a noticeable difference?

However, I only clocked 500 miles prior to being sidelined by major left foot surgery in September 2015. As a result, I've been on none-weight bearing bed rest, two none-walking casts, four hard-walking casts, two walking boots and now physical therapy since January 2016. This surgery wasn't something I expected and recovery has been a mental challenge. However, I can't wait to get back on my trike, but there is a lot of fear due to the insertion of five screws in my left foot. I'm sure, I'll need to re-adapt to riding. A few riding associates suggest I learn to use a heal shift, but I have two screws in my heel which are felt through the skin. Others suggest a hand shift, but I have caper-tunnel syndrome in both hands. I've always been a toe shifter, but I now have three screws in the top of my foot. Do any Harley riders have these issues? What did you do and how easy was it to adapt? By the way, my other bike was a 1999 Suzuki Intruder 1400 which I sold in April 2016.\n",

Last fall we discussed getting it on my lift to do wheel bearings, chain and rear sprocket to regear it for some added highway needed in our area & just give it a solid look over. Over winter it developed a primary leak while sitting so we added that to the list. It rode up from about 30 miles away last Friday. Got put on to the lift and waited until Saturday morning. * Front wheel bearings .022\" end play, set new bearings to .004\" removing stacks of .002\" & .004\" shims. * Rear wheel bearings spot on & with fresh grease. Repacked, new seals & Bob's your uncle. Then things went took a turn the wrong way every time we touched something. What started as wheel bearings is now sitting like this on my lift waiting for parts & hardware with the pile of in front of it](_URL_ * Compensator sprocket torqued on with about 30ft-lbs. * Clutch hub nut, was loose when putting the socket on it by hand. It's a tapered shaft, the hub needed a puller to take it off. So it was tight at some point in time. * The front 2 inner primary bolts(in housing) were loose. Top one about 3 turns out, bottom about one. The kicker about it, the lock tabs were bent over on the flats. * Then pulling the primary housing off. The frickin transmission is loose in the frame. I don't mean a little loose. The 5th stud to the frame = missing. The 4 nuts going to the transmission mounting plate, loose. The mounting plate itself is loose and missing a bolt in the rear & its hole has something in it. Broken bolt perhaps? The front 2 were grade 3 carriage bolts. Get the mounting plate out, no broken bolt but a stone in the hole that needed to be busted up to get it out. * Front drive sprocket loose, again with the lock tab bent over a flat. Guy is pretty lucky in that none of the big parts were damaged and all the threaded holes are not butchered. Just because that bike is a \"runner\" doesn't mean it's safe.\n",

Been riding around the freeway to and fro work in traffic and have noticed the following problems. I can hardly see anything with the stock mirrors. I am 6ft, and maxed tilt towards outside still gets me my shoulders and 10% view of the side lanes. Would the Kuryakyn mirror extenders help? I've never ridden bikes with forward controls before, hence used to moving my legs closer to the tank when riding around 110km/h. But I can't do that with the sportster. My bike has mini foot boards. Riding above 100km/h starts giving me pain in upper front right thigh. I can't enjoy those speeds at all, just feel uncomfortable. I have stock duo seat and stock handlebar. Riding between 80 and 100km/h has no problem. Would a seat fix this? I was looking at the Mustang wide touring double seat. Can I install 12.5 inch rear shocks from the 11.5 standard without having to change front fork springs? And my eternal search for a comfortable handlebar is ongoing. :) Thanks in advance!\n",

      "26: Harley Sportster Front Brake Question: Hello all, It appears I bought a poorly maintained Sportster 883. I am now in the process of fixing up everything that needs fixing. One of the first things on my list was the brakes (due to their importance). Heres the problem: The brakes were pretty squishy and didn't feel right so I dug in. After inspecting the master cylinder it was clear they're fucked. The master cylinder had DOT 5.1 fluid and a ton of gunk. I cleaned it all out. I then bled the brakes. I used a whole liter of DOT 5 through the system in order to make sure I got all the 5.1 out. I used the method with a hose and opening and closing of the bleeder valve. By the time I was done - there wasn't any air left. The problem is, the brakes are still squishy. Maybe even more so now. I bought a master cylinder rebuild kit and a caliper rebuild kit. Do ya'll think this will fix it or am I missing something? Pads are not worn passed spec. Help is appreciated, Thanks r/HD!\n",

Anyone know where to find it?: I have a 91 flhs and on the left side hard bag the lid is currently being held shut by a bungee cord because I can't seem to find the latches for sale anywhere. Anyone know who sells them or what exactly I should be searching for on eBay? I haven't been able to find them.\n",
      "28: Looking for a street bob but I have questions: I want a used street bob, but not sure what years I should target. I want a fuel injected bike WITH the 103. And the 6 speed. What year did they start with that combo? Also what would a good price be for a used one with those sort of features? Going to be my first harley so I have questions lol\n",
      "29: Buying an old Sportster as a first bike..: How terrible of a choice is an Ironhead for a first bike? I am very mechanically inclined and I love old things. Evos are nice but I think a pre 1979 sporty is substantially nicer. The hardest thing is finding one that isnt chopped out. Are they more unsafe than say.. a 2001 883? Any words of wisdom? My budget is 3k tops. Not looking to buy right now. I live in NE PA and go for my MSF class in July.\n",
      "30: Suspension Question: I have a 2006 XL1200 roadster and I mainly ride solo with no issues. My sister likes to go for rides sometimes and she is by no means much more than 100lbs... but it is not uncommon to bottom out the rear end on a decent bump. As far as I know the suspension I have is stock. What is a good upgrade that isn't going to completely break the bank that would eliminate bottoming out with two-up? Like I said, i'm not picky and I don't mind the way the stock suspension rides... I just don't like that squishy feeling i get when i have a passenger and i certainly HATE feeling it bottom out. *edit I should mention that I have already taken it to HD to have them \"adjust\" the suspension for a heavier load... Still have the issue. Thanks!\n",
      "31: Harley shocks VS aftermarket (Progressive): I came across quite a few posts about how swapping the stock Harley (Sportster) shocks with aftermarket ones made riding more enjoyable and comfy, however a few review sites happen to specifically mention how Harley has upgraded them in newer models (2016 and later if not mistaken) making them better than its predecessors. Being a 2017Iron owner and having an HDI model that comes with 13-something inch shocks, how do the factory ones compare with aftermarket, like progressive 412's? Im considering their 11.5\" Standard Duty shocks and while i am aware that loosing clearance will make the bike less agile through turns, if they also handle comparatively similar to the factory installed ones, i may as well forget about them and go for something else. Im ultimately after lowering the bike a bit for aesthetic and convenience reasons (i want to place feet confidently on ground while static) but also wouldnt mind a more enjoyable and comfortable ride. Thanks folks!\n",
      "32: Sanity Check on First Bike Purchase Please: First time purchasing a bike, took the rider course and all that. Would appreciate a last minute sanity check to calm the nerves: _URL_ Dealer dropped from 11.5k to 11k even and I said ok and that I'd be in to inspect and pick it up tomorrow. The bike was in transit from another dealership when I negotiated a price: I was originally in the dealership to get a different bike. Year is 2015, black/orange, seems stock. I can't tell whether that year has ABS or not (not really a concern for me) as assorted reviews said it did, but it's not outright specified on the dealer's page and the dealer didn't know. Looking around this state and the nearest few states I've seen prices pretty tight around the 11.5k mark for stock VRSCDX for years 2010-2015, so it's my judgement that this price is ok for a 2015 model with 5k miles, but I could be stupid, who knows. Would appreciate any advice, cheers.\n",
      "33: [Update] Help with FXS that won't start: I posted about a week ago about my 2013 FXS that wouldn't start. I left it uncovered and it got wet. I tried starter fluid, and it fires up, but it immediately shuts off once that is burned off. I drained the gas tank and it looks like some water came out as well. I added new gas, but that hasn't fixed the problem. It still continues to turn over without firing. I've used WD40 on the connections with the spark plugs, to no effect. This happened once a few months ago, but it ended up drying out and eventually working. Any help or advice is appreciated. I just want to put on a few more miles before I deploy and leave my book in working condition. Thanks.\n",
      "34: Comfortable Seat Recommendations for Iron 883 (2017): Hello Everyone, Can anyone recommend a comfortable seat for an 883? I've tried searching on other forums and the Mustang Fastback seems to be the highest rated seat, but I figured I'd ask here and see what you all have to say. Went on a 2-hour trip yesterday and my butt went numb an hour in. I plan on riding from San Diego to San Francisco in a couple of months and wanted to ensure I had something that wouldn't be nearly as exhausting. I may have a passenger, so something to keep in mind. As a bonus, here's a pic of my bike at the beach from yesterday's trip! Thanks in advance! EDIT: What about purchasing some sort of gel pad? Do those generally last quite some time or should I just get a new seat?\n",

      "39: Help with custom sissy bars; 2016 Softtail Slim S FLSS?: (Cross-posted from r/motorcycles) Firstly, I'll preface this by saying I don't know that much about bikes, but my best friend does and for his new bike he wanted custom sissy bars, so I drew up a basic design for it and he fell in love with it. Now I wanna surprise him by actually getting it made, problem is that I need the measurements for the mounts. Does anyone know what size they need to be? And is there any other pertinent information I need? I've got a couple buddies who do metal fab and welding that have offered to make them so I'm not going through like a local shop or anything that might know. Thanks in advance!\n",

      "41: Sometimes the insurance works out....: I posted up about ten weeks back about my real world experimentation with the durability of the Toyota Prius versus the impact resistance of a Harley rider. Summation: Prius build quality is almost as shit as the driving skills of the owners, but it still has enough mass to fuck up your day and then some. End result - one messed up Dyna. Thanks to the insurance-raping skills of my dealer and the persistence of my insurance agent, I picked this fine looking beast up Friday evening. Immediately proceeded to ride the tits off it. Went down to get my traditional first ride shot in front of Mt. Fuji as soon as daylight hit the next morning. (I do this for my first ride with with every bike I get my hands on, the viewpoint is at the top of a great twisty road overlooking a \\n active volcano.) Final settlement on the bike side is almost finalised, but at worst case, if they total and keep the crash bike the financing on the old bike is paid out with a few grand left over, leaving me with the new and improved bike and no change in payments and enough left over for the pipes, tuner, and a few more goodies for the new baby. Best case, I keep the old bike, already have a buyer, and I'll end up with enough to pick up a sporty as a barhopper and enough left over to have a little fun modifying it.\n",

      "43: Extended warranty question, am I getting screwed?: I purchased an extended warranty when I bought my bike from Rommels in Delaware, I'm coming up on the end of that warranty on feb 20th and lately it's been hard to start and the idle is off so I figured I'd get it fixed before the warranty is up. Sometimes I start it and the idle is really high, other times it idles low enough that without giving it gas I'd stall at a stop light.Its a 2009 night train with 43000 miles. Anyway, I dropped it off at Barbs in nj because it's the closest dealer to me for the warranty work and ask them to take a look at it. Earlier in the day I received a phone call asking if I wanted to trade it in, I told them no way because I love the bike, about 2 hours later I receive a call that the dealership says the warranty company won't honor the extended warranty because it has a power commander and most likely the power commander is bad. The bike was throwing a code but I don't remember what it was.I bought the bike with the power commander on it. I had warranty work done before and it wasn't a problem. Have any of you dealt with this before and do you think either the warranty company or the dealership is trying to screw me? I know this post is long as hell but I'd appreciate any help you guys could give me.\n",

      "47: 2016 Iron turn signal relocation questions: I'm planning on putting some Biltwell Chumps on my 2016 Iron 883, and I was thinking that instead of messing with the wiring, it'd be smarter, easier, and look better if I relocated my turn signals instead of trying to keep them on the handlebars. While some bikes can look great with the relocation kit that Harley offers, I feel like that kit makes the lights stick out a bit far for the look I want for my bike. That being said I was thinking of getting the J&P Fork Clamps or possibly the Arlen Ness Turn Signal Mounts. On to my questions: Has anyone here tried out those items or something similar? If so, how difficult was the installation and how happy were you with the look of the kit afterwards? Thank you! Edit: I'm also considering the Custom Dynamics Fork Wrap Arounds as well, but I'm not sure how difficult the installation would be.\n",
